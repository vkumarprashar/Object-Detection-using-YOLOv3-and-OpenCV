# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3-and-OpenCV
 This project is made the final lab project of Data Mining and Analysis. The project report is also included in the repository.
In this project we are detecting an image which contains different objects like man, woman, animal, things etc. using different concepts and technique of images used in Computer Vision. 
We are also detecting objects in the video by dividing the video into the frames and applying object detection on frames, whole video part is done by using the Open CV.
